# Project 3: Exoplanet classification

Project 3 of the the FYS-STK3155 UiO course as found [here on the course's GitHub](https://github.com/CompPhysics/MachineLearning/blob/master/doc/Projects/2023/Project3/pdf/Project3.pdf)

We aim to use and compare three methods of classification for the Kaggle dataset [Exoplanet hunting in deep space](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/keplersmachines/kepler-labelled-time-series-data)
We focus on; 1) Logistic regression, 2) Classification neural network, and 3) Classification decision tree
