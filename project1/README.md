# Project 1

Project 1 of the FYS-STK3155 UiO course as found here
https://compphysics.github.io/MachineLearning/doc/LectureNotes/_build/html/project1.html.

We study the three linear regression methods ordinary least squares, ridge, and lasso. We use the Franke function to 
see how the mean squared error and R^2-scores are affected by the model complexity and other parameters.
